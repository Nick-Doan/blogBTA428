        <h1>Your Browser Knows What You Did Last Session</h1>
        
        <p>So, you’re browsing the internet, looking at YouTube shorts, TikTok, and the occasional cat video. But what if I told you that everything you’re doing is being tracked and recorded? That’s right, your browser knows what you did last session.</p>

        <h2>Ways You Are Being Tracked</h2>
        <p>Ok, that’s not what’s happening, but I wanted to make the point that your internet activity is being recorded and tracked. How you might be asking? There’s a lot to talk about. Cookies, ads, your browser history, etc. Not those cookies, I’m talking about web cookies. They are text files that websites deploy to collect data about your activity on their website. For example, Amazon notices that you are looking at teen romance books and that data is collected by Amazon’s cookies. Later that day you notice that you’re getting ads about teen romance books on Facebook. This would be known as a third-party tracking cookie since the data the cookies collect is being used to give you targeted ads across another website. Cookies can do a wide range of things. They can remember your password, IP address, track your activity, your device, your operating system, and many other things.</p>

        <h3>Browser History</h3>
        <p>Another way your data is being collected is your browser history. Chrome is one of the biggest browsers on the market and they know a lot about you. Chrome collects your browser history even in incognito mode (<a href="https://cyberguy.com/news/google-finally-admits-data-collection-chromes-incognito-mode/">Kohli et al., 2024</a>). Safari collects data about you as well, but Apple does allow you to download your own data they have collected on you. A lot of companies have been doing this due to regulations (<a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10625-businesses-collecting-data.html">Freedman, 2023</a>).</p>

        <h3>Search Engine</h3>
        <img src="images/google-spy-eye.png", width="100%">
        <p>Alright, alright, what else is collecting data about me from my Browser? I’m glad you asked. Your search engine is also collecting data about you! Google absolutely collects data about what you have been searching (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-app-gmail-chrome-data/">Burgess, 2021</a>). Their entire business is built on it so it is no wonder that they do. You might be thinking, “Why should I care?” Google knows things like your work route, what hours you are on the internet, your job, your friends, choices of content, where you live, and a host of other things. They do this by combining all the data they have on you and building a very accurate picture of who you are (<a href="https://tuta.com/blog/what-does-google-know-about-me">Everything Google Knows about You and How to Stop It!, 2024</a>). Here’s a quote from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, “We know where you are. We know where you’ve been. We can more or less know what you’re thinking about”.</p>

        <h2>What You Can Do About It</h2>
        <h3>Open Source Software</h3>
        <p>Ok, you’ve scared me. Now what? I’m glad you are concerned. Here’s what you can do to protect your data without living out in the woods. A data pragmatist approach to choosing the right browser for you. The first criterion we will be looking at is the browser code itself! “Why?” In software, there are two types of software: open source software and closed source software. Open source software is where the code is free to use and the code is open for anyone to look at and see. It’s like having the recipe for a dish. You can see everything that’s in it. Closed source software is where the code is not free and the code is not available for anyone to look at. It’s like a secret recipe. This ties in as we want to know what the browser itself is doing with our data. Using an open source browser lets us do just that.</p>

        <h3>Usability</h3>
        <p>The next criterion is usability. Even if a browser is open source and we know for certain our data isn’t being used in ways that we don’t want it to, it’s pointless if the browser is horrible to use. Certain browsers like the TOR browser are incredible when it comes to security but not practical for the average user. The TOR browser was developed by Dr. Paul Syverson to help protect U.S. Navy intelligence agents. It breaks a lot of websites that you would normally be able to use. Another aspect of usability is add-ons and if websites support them. Some browsers will be incompatible with certain websites if they are not supported. Think about how certain websites tell you that you need to use Chrome, Safari, or Firefox.</p>

        <h3>Recommended Browsers</h3>
        <p>Here’s a small list of open source browsers that have high usability:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Brave</li>
            <li>Firefox</li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Wait, that is literally two?" It is because the market for privacy-oriented browsers that have high usability is low. There are a lot of options on the market, but they take a significant amount of research and time for the average user to get used to, so I excluded those ones. Firefox and Brave work out of the box and take very little time to get used to.</p>


        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>Your browser tracks and records your online activities through various means such as cookies, browser history, and search engines. Cookies, small text files stored by websites, can track your preferences, passwords, IP address, and activities across different sites, leading to targeted ads. Browser history is another data source your browser can use to track and collect your data. Search engines gather extensive information about your searches, location, and online habits which can be used to create detailed profiles of users. To protect your data, consider using open-source browsers like Brave and Firefox, which offer transparency and better privacy controls, without compromising usability.</p>
